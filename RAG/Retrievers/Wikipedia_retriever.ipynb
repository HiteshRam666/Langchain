However, unbeknownst to Manickam and Sakthivel, Sadanand later invalidates the truce by orchestrating a shootout involving the Delhi Police. The ensuing tussle results in the death of a newspaper deliveryman caught in the crossfire when he is unknowingly shot by Manickam, leaving his children, Amaran and Chandra, separated. Sakthivel believes Amaran shielded him during the chaos. Moved by the incident after learning that Amaran\\'s father was the newspaper delivery man, Sakthivel adopts him and raises him as his own son, while promising Amaran that he will find Chandra.\\nIn 2016, Manickam’s daughter, Shanthi, dies by suicide after being cheated by Sadanand’s nephew, Ranvijay Yadav. In retaliation, Amaran captures Ranvijay, who Sakthivel kills. As a result, Sakthivel is imprisoned, leaving Amaran in charge of the empire. Later, Manickam and Amaran meet Sadanand, who proposes a peace deal again: he will enter politics, and Amaran can take over his business territories. Though initially displeased, Sakthivel eventually accepts the arrangement and is released from prison. Upon his return, he approves of his daughter Mangai’s relationship with Naaga, son of his henchman Sivaguru, and arranges their wedding. During the ceremony, he observes the shifting dynamics of his empire, with everyone now treating Amaran as the leader, concerning him as he thinks Amaran might overthrow him.\\nWhile traveling with his gang, Sakthivel narrowly survives an assassination attempt by henchmen of Deepak, Ranvijay\\'s older brother, who swears to avenge his brother\\'s death by finishing Sakthivel, despite Sadanand\\'s reluctance due to their deal.
